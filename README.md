# Getting started with HTML, CSS and Javascript

To gain experience with HTML, you are going to make a basic 2-page website about yourself, like a portfolio. Follow the instructions, but get interested and do extra stuff if you can.

## Home page
•	in the index.html...

•	Add the following code to your page:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
	<body>
	
	
	</body>
</html>

```

- save the code
- Now let’s add a title for our home page. Enter the text below, between the <head> tags.

Now we’ll add some content. First add a heading that says "My name is " and your name. Make sure this code is entered after the first body tag.

```

<body>
<h1>My name is Dianna</h1>

```

•	Next we will add an image. the pizza.jpg is located in the img folder. Add the following code to display the pizza image:

```
<img src="pizza_sm.jpg" alt="Pizza Time">
```

•	The alt attribute tells screen readers what is in the picture
•	 Next, use the paragraph tag to surround some text where you describe yourself.

<p>I am a very interesting person. I like to ....   I am well known for ... </p>
•	Save your page and run it.

## A linked page
You are going to make 1 more page called aboutme.html
Start these off very briefly, as the content is not the most important thing, but we need some content to practise formatting it.
•	Create a second page  for aboutme and give it a similar title and, at least, appropriately formatted paragraphs):
o	where you were born
o	past jobs
o	your first memory of using the Web
•	If you would like a bulleted list you can use the following code:

```

ul>
<li>born</li>
<li>jobs</li>
<li>memories
</ul>

```

•	Add the icecream.jpg image from the img folder and say something about it.
•	Save this page as aboutme.html - It's best not to use spaces in any filenames for the Web, and they should always be logical names, not page2.html, which you won't recognise later.
•	Now we need to make links...
•	Underneath the icecream image we need to place a link back to our home page. Use the following code:

```

<a href="index.html">Home</a>

```

•	Save your page and run it. When you click the link it should return you to index.html.

•	Put a link tag on the home page to link to aboutme.html. Run it, and make sure the links work. 

Extension exercises:
Go to the W3C HTML5 tutorial at: https://www.w3schools.com/html/
Try out three new tags and put them in your site. Some things you might like to try are:
•	ordered lists (lists with numbers)
•	clickable images (an image in an anchor tag)
•	email link (how is this different than a regular anchor tag?)
